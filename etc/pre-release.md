### Information ###
This is a continuously-deployed, pre-release build of TurboNeRF's python library.  It is meant to be used by the [Blender Addon](https://github.com/JamesPerlman/blender_nerf_tools).  This project is currently in pre-alpha testing, so if you have come to this page it is either because you were invited as a tester, or you're just a curious person!  There are no public instructions for testing, and the functionality is extremely limited.  If you'd like to become a tester, I'd love to have you!  Send an email to james at jperl dot net and tell me a bit about yourself and what you'd like to do with NeRF.
